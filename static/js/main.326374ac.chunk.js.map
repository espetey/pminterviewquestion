I decided to build a quick app to help me step through various recommended interview questions in a way that mimics a real interview. It is also a good script for the friends I convince to give me a mock interview. I hope it will be useful for anyone else who is going through the same process.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The progression of the interview here (which does not neccessarily parallel an actual PM interview) is built from a random selection of categorized questions in the following order:\r\n          </p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>Courtesy opener - 1 question</li>\r\n          <li>General interview - 4 questions</li>\r\n          <li>Communication/Leadership - 2 questions</li>\r\n          <li>Communication/Behavioral - 2 questions</li>\r\n          <li>Communication/Conflict - 2 questions</li>\r\n          <li>Product/Design - 5 questions</li>\r\n          <li>Product/Strategy - 5 questions</li>\r\n          <li>Technical/General - 4 questions</li>\r\n          <li>Technical/Analysis - 2 questions</li>\r\n          <li>Technical/Engineering - 2 questions</li>\r\n          <li>Courtesy closers - 2 questions</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I have included \"Technical/Engineering\" questions by default for coverage on Technical Product Manager positions. As time permits I'll add a few bells and whistles here to customize the question flow for other configurations (technical/non-technical, company specific, and category specific).\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"info\">\r\n        <h3>Add a question, company, or product</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <a className=\"App-link\" href=\"https://github.com/espetey/pminterviewquestion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open a pull request on GitHub</a>.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"info\">\r\n        <h3>Why the pictures of people?</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This fun little website is no substitue for interviewing with real people, either in an actual job interview or with a friend or colleague in a mock interview setting.
